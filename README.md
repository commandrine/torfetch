Pre-requisite is that you have installed TorCrawl and run the tool to list paths and files of an Onion site.
You can place the script in the same folder as TorCrawl.

torfetch example:
python torfetch.py http://[insert onion URL here] [insert TorCrawl output to reference] -o [insert path to download to]
